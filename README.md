Such a project consists of several components:

1. Analysis and processing of stock market data - taking data from various sources, such as stock market APIs, reading and processing CSV or JSON files, and processing them to obtain the necessary information.
2. Implementing various trading strategies - implementing various trading algorithms and strategies, such as arbitrage, day trading, momentum trading, scalping, etc.
3. Backtesting of trading strategies - using previously collected data to test and optimize the selected trading strategy.
4. User interface - creating a user interface where the user could select a trading strategy, specify input parameters, test the strategy and make trading decisions.
5. Support for various financial instruments - enable trading of various financial instruments such as stocks, indices, currencies, options, etc.
6. Integration with real stock market APIs - implement functionality to connect directly with stock market APIs to enable real trading.
